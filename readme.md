# Node
This is a repository of my adventures with node.js.

Here are a few projects I have worked on to get more acquainted with Node.js
- [Node JSON Notes Project](https://github.com/Gabriel-Lewis/node/tree/master/first_project)
- [Weather App](https://github.com/Gabriel-Lewis/node-weather-app)
- [Node Testing with Mocha](https://github.com/Gabriel-Lewis/node/tree/master/node-test)
